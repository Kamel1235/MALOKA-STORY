// INITIAL_PRODUCTS has been moved to public/data/products.json
// This file can be removed or repurposed if it holds other product-related utilities or types.
// For now, I will leave it empty to signify the data has moved. If no other utilities are added here,
// it can be safely deleted, and imports from this file should be removed or updated.

// Example: If you had other product related constants or functions, they would remain here.
// export const MAX_PRODUCT_IMAGES = 5;

// Keeping the file for now, but its primary content (INITIAL_PRODUCTS) is gone.
